            <p class="heading" >Introduction to Compiler Design<p>
            <p class="content">
                Compiler Design is a crucial course in the field of computer science that focuses on the study of creating efficient and robust compilers. Compilers are essential tools that translate high-level programming languages into low-level machine code that a computer's processor can execute.
                The primary objective of the Compiler Design course is to equip students with the knowledge and skills required to design, implement, and optimize compilers for various programming languages. Students learn the theoretical concepts and practical techniques to convert source code written in programming languages like C, C++, Java, or Python into executable machine code.
                The Introduction to Compilers topic serves as the foundation for the course, providing an overview of the compiler's role in software development. Students learn about the different phases involved in the compilation process, starting from source code to machine code generation. The main focus is on understanding the components and functionalities of a compiler, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, optimization, and code generation.

            <p class="heading" >Lexical Analysis<p>
            <p class="content">
                Lexical Analysis is the first phase of the compiler, also known as scanning. It involves breaking the source code into a sequence of tokens, which are the smallest meaningful units in the programming language. Tokens can include identifiers, keywords, operators, literals, and punctuation symbols. Students study regular expressions and finite automata to design efficient lexical analyzers. They also learn to handle errors and report meaningful error messages during the lexical analysis phase.

        <div class="article" id="parsing">
            <p class="heading" >Syntax Analysis (Parsing)<p>
            <p class="content">
                The Syntax Analysis phase, also known as parsing, is responsible for analyzing the sequence of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer to check whether it adheres to the language's grammar rules. Students explore various parsing techniques, such as top-down parsing and bottom-up parsing, and study context-free grammars. The course covers parsing algorithms like LL(1), LR(0), SLR(1), LALR(1), and LR(1). Students implement parsers to build parse trees or abstract syntax trees representing the syntactic structure of the source code.

        <div class="article" id="semantic">
            <p class="heading" >Semantic Analysis<p>
            <p class="content">
                Semantic Analysis is the phase where the compiler checks the meaning of the code and ensures that it follows the language's semantic rules and type systems. Students learn about type checking, symbol table management, scope resolution, and data type inference. This phase helps detect semantic errors and ensures that the code adheres to the language's semantics, promoting correct program behavior during execution.

            <p class="heading" >Intermediate Code Generation<p>
            <p class="content">
                Intermediate Code Generation is a crucial step in compiler design that creates an intermediate representation of the source code. This intermediate code is more abstract than the source code but closer to the machine code. Students learn about different forms of intermediate representations, such as three-address code, abstract syntax trees, and quadruples. This phase simplifies the compilation process and enables easier optimization and portability.

        <div class="article" id="co">
            <p class="heading" >Code Optimization<p>
            <p class="content">
                Code Optimization is the process of improving the efficiency and performance of the generated machine code. Students explore various optimization techniques, such as constant folding, dead code elimination, loop optimization, and register allocation. The goal is to minimize execution time and memory usage while maximizing the performance of the compiled code.

            <p class="heading" >Code Generation<p>
            <p class="content">
                The final phase of the compiler is Code Generation, where the intermediate code is transformed into the target machine code or assembly language specific to the target hardware. Students learn about instruction selection, code templates, and generating efficient code sequences for different architectures. They study the working of the target machine and the translation of intermediate code constructs into machine instructions.
